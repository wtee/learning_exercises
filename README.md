What's this?
============

This repository is a playground for simple learning exercises,
so don't expect any serious code here.

Things you might find here:
* Excercises from tutorials.
* Code katas.
* Excercises to better understand CS concepts like algorithms
  and data structures.
* Code for challenges or wikis, etc. (Think Project Euler or Rosetta Code.)
* Other similar things.
* This README.md
